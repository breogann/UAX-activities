### Activity 2.1.3

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_2.1.3.ipynb` and in a new cell type the following variable which contains a sample of bank clients (refer to the `Activity 2.1.1`).

<br>

Answer the following tasks **using Python loops**:

- Go through the bank clients and print their name and their balance separately. The output should look like

  ```shell
   Male:
    client_name1, balance1: $ xyz
    client_name2, balance2: $ zzz
    ...

   Female:
    client_name3, balance3: $ xcz
    client_name4, balance4: $ vzx
    ...
   ```

   Hint1: create two empty lists for males and females and loop over clients and fill the lists with the information with [append](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp)
   Hint2: combine prints with loop in order to solve the exercise

- Compute and print the average balance for males and females.
- What is the average age of all the clients?
- How many clients are active?
- How many **unique** eye colors have the clients?

Consider making use of variables, loops and if-else.
