### Activity 3.2.1

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_3.2.1.ipynb` and in a new cell type the following array:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline

np.random.seed(17)
data1 = np.random.chisquare(2,10000)
data2 = np.random.exponential(1,10000)
data3 = np.random.gamma(2,10000)
```

<br>

Create a pandas dataframe with data1, data2, data3 arranged as columns and as columnames: "data1", "data2", "data3" and do the following:

- Compute the mean and the standard deviation of each column
- Plot the distribution of each column
- Which column has bigger variance?
- Which column has the smallest standard deviation?
- Reorder the columns of the dataframe in order of increasing variance from left to right
- Show in one plot the boxplots of each column using seaborn
