### Activity 3.1.1 - Solution

```python
# ¡¡Remember!! To access NumPy and its functions import it in your Python code: import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1, 4, 9],
       [5, 3, 5]])
# We can create a NumPy array object by using the array() function.
```

#### Exercise 1

* Print the first row of the previous array

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    a[0,:] 
    # The value before the comma specifies the row, the value after the comma specifies the column
       # first row: 0 (remember indexes in python starts with 0)
       # we use ":" because we want all teh values of the frist row
    ```

<br>

* Print the second row of the previous array

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    a[1,:]
    # The value before the comma specifies the row, the value after the comma specifies the column
       # second row: 1 (remember indexes in python starts with 0)
       # we use ":" because we want all the values of the frist row
    ```

<br>

* Print the second column of the previous array

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    a[:,1]
    # The value before the comma specifies the row, the value after the comma specifies the column
       # we use ":"  because we want information of all the rows
       # 1: we only want the second column of all rows (again, remember how indexes work in python)
    ```

<br>

* Print the element of the array which contains the number '3'

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    a[1,1]
    # The value before the comma specifies the row, the value after the comma specifies the column
       # we know that number 3 is in the second row, in the second colum, so we retrieve it by accesing second position y second row.
    ```

<br>

* Reshape the array in order to have 3 rows and 2 columns

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    a.reshape(3,2)
    # numpy.reshape gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
    # (3,2) -> newshape, should be compatible with the original shape. order = (row, columns)
    
    ```

<br>

#### Exercise 2

Consider the following Numpy array:

```python
b = np.array([[ 1,  2],
       [ 3,  4],
       [ 5,  6],
       [ 7,  8],
       [ 9, 10],
       [11, 12]])
```

* Compute the sum of all the numbers of the array using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.sum(b)
    # sum function: Sum of array elements.
    ```

<br>


* Compute the sum of all the numbers in each row using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.sum(b, axis = 1)
    # sum function, axis parameter: Axis or axes along which a sum is performed. (The default axis=None)
    # axis 1 = rows
    ```

<br>

* Compute the sum of all the numbers in each column using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.sum(b, axis = 0)
    # sum function, axis parameter: Axis or axes along which a sum is performed. (The default axis=None)
    # axis 0 = colums
    ```

<br>

* Compute the mean of all the numbers of the array using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.mean(b)
    # numpy.mean function computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis
    ```

<br>

* Compute the mean of all the numbers in each row using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.mean(b, axis = 1)
    #axis 1 = rows
    ```

<br>

* Compute the mean of all the numbers in each column using Numpy functions

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    np.mean(b, axis = 0)
    # axis 0 = colums
    ```
