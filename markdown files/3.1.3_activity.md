### Activity 3.1.3

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_3.1.3.ipynb`.

In this case you are going to work with a planets dataset already available in Seaborn. Open a new cell an type:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")
```

Now try to get some insights about the data.

- Get descriptive statistics of the dataset using pandas.
- Get the *unique* values of the column `method`.
- Use [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) to compute the mean `mass` by `method`

You should obtain:

```
method
Astrometry                            NaN
Eclipse Timing Variations        5.125000
Imaging                               NaN
Microlensing                          NaN
Orbital Brightness Modulation         NaN
Pulsar Timing                         NaN
Pulsation Timing Variations           NaN
Radial Velocity                  2.630699
Transit                          1.470000
Transit Timing Variations             NaN
Name: mass, dtype: float64
```

- Generate a scatterplot with matplotlib with `mass` on the `x` axis and `orbital_period` on the `y` axis. Can you see any relationhip?
- Generate a barplot with matplotlib to show the number of discovered planets by `method`.
- Show a barplot of number planets discovered by `year`.
- Show a histogram for column `mass`.
