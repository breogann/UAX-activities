### Activity 2.2.1 - Solution

- Create a lambda function to return a float number from the balance of each client.

**Solution**:

```python
b = lambda c: float(c['balance'][1:].replace(",","")) # lambda function to get balance as float and remove $ sign
```

<br>

- Use loops to iterate over each client and print the information shown below their balance (as a float number).

The expected output must be:

```
Client name: name
Gender: gender
Balance: balance

Client name: name
Gender: gender
Balance: balance

Client name: name
Gender: gender
Balance: balance

...
```

<br>

**Solution**:

```python
b = lambda c: float(c['balance'][1:].replace(",","")) # lambda function to get balance as float and remove $ sign

for client in clients: # for each client in clients list 
     print("Client name: {}".format(client['name'])) # print client name 
     print("Gender: {}".format(client['gender'])) # print client gender
     print("Balance: {}".format(b(client))) # print client balance
```
