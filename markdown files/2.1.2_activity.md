### Activity 2.1.2

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_2.1.2.ipynb` and in a new cell type the following variable which contains the previous sample of bank clients (refer to the `Activity 2.1.1`).

The bank wants to group together their clients based on their balance according to the following conditions:

- Balance < $ 1,000.00 -> **Bronze** 
- $ 1,000.00 <= Balance < $ 2,000.00 -> **Silver** 
- $ 2,000.00 <= Balance < $ 3,000.00 -> **Gold** 
- Balance > $3,000.00 -> **VIP**

Consider the client one by one and classify the clients according to the previous conditions.

Your task is to determine to which group belongs each client and print the following replacing the client_nameX and client_group for each client one by one *without* using loops. The output should look like: 

```python
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name1,client_group))
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name2,client_group))
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name3,client_group))
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name4,client_group))
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name5,client_group))
print("The client: {} is of type {}".format(client_name6,client_group))
```
