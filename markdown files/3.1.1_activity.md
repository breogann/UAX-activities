### Activity 3.1.1

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_3.1.1.ipynb` and in a new cell type the following array

```python
a = np.array([[1, 4, 9],
       [5, 3, 5]])
```
#### Exercise 1

- Print the first row of the previous array
- Print the second row of the previous array
- Print the second column of the previous array
- Print the element of the array which contains the number '3'
- Reshape the array in order to have 3 rows and 2 columns


#### Exercise 2

Consider the following Numpy array:

```python
b = np.array([[ 1,  2],
       [ 3,  4],
       [ 5,  6],
       [ 7,  8],
       [ 9, 10],
       [11, 12]])
```

- Compute the sum of all the numbers of the array using Numpy functions
- Compute the sum of all the numbers in each row using Numpy functions
- Compute the sum of all the numbers in each column using Numpy functions
- Compute the mean of all the numbers of the array using Numpy functions
- Compute the mean of all the numbers in each row using Numpy functions
- Compute the mean of all the numbers in each column using Numpy functions
