### Activity 2.2.3 - Solution

Your tasks are the following:

- Create a user defined function which:
  1. takes the clients lists as input 
  2. **returns** a **list** of clients who have a balance over $ 2,000.00 and are not active 

Every element of this list should contain a dictionary with **only the following keys: "name", "balance", "phone" and "email".

Hint: Go step by step. Define a basic function and the refine it until you get the expected output with one single value.

The expected output should be:

```python
[
  {'name': 'Jeannette Eaton', 'balance': '$3,918.11', 'phone': '+1 (807) 419-3284','email': 'jeannetteeaton@obliq.com'},
  {'name': 'Ayers Butler',    'balance': '$3,631.26', 'phone': '+1 (890) 449-3416','email': 'ayersbutler@enerforce.com'},
  {'name': 'Elaine Jimenez',  'balance': '$2,746.40', 'phone': '+1 (918) 490-3805','email': 'elainejimenez@senmao.com'}
]
```

**Solution**:

```python
def filter_clients(clients_list): # function that receives a list of clients
     b = lambda c: float(c['balance'][1:].replace(",","")) #lambda expression. It defines a function that receives a client and returns the balance of the client as a float removing the comma and the dollar sign
     final_list = [] #initializing variable to store the result of the function
     for client in clients_list: #for loop itering list clients
             if ( b(client) > 2000 and client['isActive'] == False ): #if statement. Checks if the balance of the client is greater than 2000 and if the client is inactive
                     final_list.append({'name': client['name'], 'balance': client['balance'], 'phone': client['phone'], 'email': client['email']}) #if the condition is satisfied, it appends the client to the list final_list and stores the result in the variable
     return final_list #returns the list final_list

filter_clients(clients) #calls the function filter_clients and stores the result in the variable clients
```

- Modify the previous function to add an optional argument "active" which will be `False` by default and use this argument inside the function to filter the clients.

**Solution**:

```python
def filter_clients(clients_list, active = False): # function that receives a list of clients and a boolean value to filter the list
     b = lambda c: float(c['balance'][1:].replace(",","")) #lambda expression. It defines a function that receives a client and returns the balance of the client as a float removing the comma and the dollar sign
     final_list = [] #initializing variable to store the result of the function
     for client in clients_list: #for loop itering list clients
             if ( b(client) > 2000 and client['isActive'] == active ): #if statement. Checks if the balance of the client is greater than 2000 and if the client is inactive
                     final_list.append({'name': client['name'], 'balance': client['balance'], 'phone': client['phone'], 'email': client['email']}) # if the condition is satisfied, it appends the client to the list final_list and stores the result in the variable
     return final_list #returns the list final_list

filter_clients(clients, active = False) # calls the function filter_clients and stores the result in the variable clients
```

<br>

- Call your function with the "active" argument set to "True" and verify that you only get active customers with a balance over $2,000.00.

**Solution**:

```python
filter_clients(clients, active = True)  # calls the function filter_clients and stores the result in the variable clients
```
