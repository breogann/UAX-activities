### Activity 4.1.2

Make a copy of the code along jupyter notebook and name it as `Activity_4.1.2.ipynb`. 

Solution 

**See notebook `4.1.2_activity_solution.ipynb`!!!**
 
- Restart the Kernel and clear the output
- Run all the cells until the section `Data Splitting`
- Run again the `train_test_split` function but this time set the option `random_state` to any other integer value with two digits
- Replace the names of the scaler in the `save_scaler()` function
- Replace the name of the model in the `save_model()` function
- Run the remaining cells to generate a new model
- Compare the new coefficients of the model with the old ones obtained in the code along

```
Old coefficients:
array([ 0.48616037, -0.03823913,  0.08677916,  0.10821631,  0.6305174 ,
       -0.03051781, -0.07136718, -0.05407714])

Old intercept:
9.109006822397197

New coefficients:
array([ 0.49604318, -0.04100977,  0.08933999,  0.12024496,  0.61556761,
       -0.03768807, -0.06793841, -0.06979858])

New intercept:
9.115071670174284
```

They have changed because the sample is different, even though the change is small.
This shows two things:
  - the model depends on the sample!!!
  - this particular model seems to be quite robust as the coefficients doesn't change too much
  - more and more samples should be drawn to perform an statistical analysis of the estimated coefficients

 - Are the most important variables the same? - Yes
 - Are the associated coefficients the same as the obtained during the lesson? - Of course not, for **this particular case!!!**
