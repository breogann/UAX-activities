### Activity 3.2.2 - Solution


* Load the file `test.csv`  ( included in the "activities" folder ) into a Pandas dataframe

    **Solution**

    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv("data/test.csv", sep = ";")
    # pandas.read_csv Read a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame.
      # sep = Delimiter to use.
    ```

<br>

* Make a single plot of all pairs of variables

    **Solution**

    ```python
    sns.pairplot(data);
    # seaborn.pairplot: Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset. 
      # creates a grid of Axes such that each numeric variable in data will by shared across the y-axes across a single row and the x-axes across a single column.
    ```

<br>

* Compute the correlation matrix

    **Solution**

    ```python
    data.corr()
    # dataframe.corr()  is used to find the pairwise correlation of all columns in the dataframe.
      # Any na values are automatically excluded. For any non-numeric data type columns in the dataframe it is ignored.
    ```

<br>

* Did you found any pair of variables highly correlated ( abs(c) > 0.75 )?

    **Solution**

    ```python
    # Yes, all
    ```

<br>

* Do you think that some variable follows a normal distribution?

    **Solution**

    ```python
    # No.
    ```
