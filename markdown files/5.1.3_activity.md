### Activity 5.1.3

Make a copy of the last activity notebook and name it `Activity_5.1.3.ipynb`. Then answer the following questions:

1. Imagine that you did your data workflow in a single Jupyter notebook and you forgot to save your new model that took you several hours to train. Now for some reason your computer freezes and you need to restart the kernel and run it again. How much time it will take to you to finish running the notebook?
2. What would happen if you had saved the model before?
