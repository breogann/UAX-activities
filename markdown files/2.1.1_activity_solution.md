### Activity 2.1.1 - Solution

Answer the following questions using Python code:

- How many clients has the bank?

```python
len(clients)

# len is a Built-in function.
# Return the length (the number of items) of an object. (string, bytes, tuple, list, range, dictionary, set)
```

- How many `keys` has each client?

```python
len(clients[0].keys()) 

# clients[0] returns the first element of the list clients (in this case all elements of the list are dictionaries)
  # (In python the indexing is based upon the distance from the starting point, so the index of first element is 0)
# .keys() is one of Python Dictionary Methods.
  # returns a view object that displays A LIST of all the keys in the dictionary in order of insertion.
# Using LEN we get number of items of the LIST of Keys
```

- How many elements has the `tags` key?

```python
len(clients[0]["tags"])

# we get the first element of the list: clients[0]
# A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets -> ['tags']
  # in this case this value is a list
# using LEN we get the number of elements in the list we have retrieved with key 'tags'
```

- Get the balance of the first client?

```python
clients[0]['balance'] 
```

- Get the balance of the last client? 

```python
clients[-1]['balance'] 

# using negative index [-1] we get the last element of a LIST
# since we want to know the `balance` of the last client we retrieve the value using the key ['balance']
```

- What is the balance difference between the first client and the last client in $?
  Hint1: use `replace(string_to_replace,new_string)` to `clean` the balance [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp)
  Hint2: use `float()` to get float numbers before substracting the balances.

```python
round(float(clients[0]['balance'][1:].replace(",","")) - float(clients[-1]['balance'][1:].replace(",","")),2)

#round: Built-in function: round(number[, ndigits])
  # Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to its input.
# the ['balance'] of each client is a string that starts with '$'.
  #We only want to get the numbers, so we use the index method of a string to retrieve all the characters except the first one -> ['balance][1:]
#first client = clients[0], last client = clients[-1]
```

- Get the surname of the third client.

```python
clients[2]['name'].split()[1] 

#third client = clients[2] (indexing starts in 0)
#the key of the cliente ['name'] returns a string: two words separated by a whitespace (first word: name, second: surname)
#The split() method splits a string into a list
  #You can specify the separator, default separator is any whitespace.
  #in this case we have two words separted by a whitesapce, so the list retrieved has two elements.
  #we need the second element of this list to get the surname -> we use [1] to get the second element.
```

- For the last client, get the phone number without the prefix and area code (ie: xyz-mnv).

```python
clients[-1]['phone'].split()[-1] 

# last client: clients[-1]
# phone number: value of key ['phone'] -> A string separated in three groups by whitespaces
# using slpit() we get a list of three elements, the first element is the prefix, the second is the area code and the last is the number
  #we retrieve the number using the negative index [-1] (last element of the list)

```
