### Activity 3.1.2

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_3.1.2.ipynb`.

Refer to the folder `activities/data/` for this exercise. 

In this activity you will work with data which unfortunately is split in several files. Therefore, you will have to load each file and then combine them in a Pandas dataframe. Open a new code cell in the notebook and type:

```python
import pandas as pd  
import numpy as np

# Reading data
file1 = pd.read_csv('file1.csv')
file1.head()
file2 = pd.read_csv('file2.txt', sep = '\t')  # Txt files have a different field separator
```

With this, you have created two dataframes named `file1` and `file2` respectively. Now you would like to combine both dataframes into a single one. To do this, open a new code cell and type:

```python
# Data blending
column_names = file1.columns # We get the colum names.
data = pd.DataFrame(columns=column_names) # We define an empty dataframe called `data having as many columns as the ones present in file1
data = pd.concat([data,file1, file2], axis=0)
data.shape # This returns a tuple displaying the number of rows and columns, ie: ( #rows, #columns )
```

Now it's time to work!

- Load data (`file3.xlsx` and `file4.xlsx`) using [read_excel](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html). You might face an error saying that optional dependency `xlrd` is missing. In that case, open a new `code` cell before the one in which you tried to load the data and type:

```
!pip install xlrd
```

If you don't get the error, move to the next step.

- Print the first columns of dataframes file3 and file4.
- Check the names and order of columns in the dataframes file3 and file4, and compare them with the "data" DataFrame created before.
- Change the names of required columns in the new dataframes read before concatenating the files with data.
- Change data columns from uppercase to lowercase.
- Save the final dataframe into a file named `full_data.csv`
