### Activity 2.2.3

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_2.2.3.ipynb` and in a new cell type the following variable which contains a sample of bank clients (refer to the `Activity 2.2.1`).

Your tasks are the following:

- Create a user defined function which:
  1. takes the clients lists as input 
  2. **returns** a **list** of clients who have a balance over $ 2,000.00 and are not active 

Every element of this list should contain a dictionary with **only the following keys: "name", "balance", "phone" and "email".

Hint: Go step by step. Define a basic function and the refine it until you get the expected output with one single value.

The expected output should be:

```python
[
  {'name': 'Jeannette Eaton', 'balance': '$3,918.11', 'phone': '+1 (807) 419-3284','email': 'jeannetteeaton@obliq.com'},
  {'name': 'Ayers Butler',    'balance': '$3,631.26', 'phone': '+1 (890) 449-3416','email': 'ayersbutler@enerforce.com'},
  {'name': 'Elaine Jimenez',  'balance': '$2,746.40', 'phone': '+1 (918) 490-3805','email': 'elainejimenez@senmao.com'}
]
```

- Modify the previous function to add an optional argument "active" which will be `False` by default and use this argument inside the function to filter the clients.

- Call your function with the "active" argument set to "True" and verify that you only get active customers with a balance over $2,000.00.
