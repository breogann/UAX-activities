### Activity 2.1.3 - Solution

Answer the following tasks using Python loops:

- Go through the bank clients and print their name and their balance separately. The output should look like

  ```shell
   Males:
    client_name1, balance1: $ xyz
    client_name2, balance2: $ zzz
    ...

   Females:
    client_name3, balance3: $ xcz
    client_name4, balance4: $ vzx
    ...
   ```

   Hint1: create two empty lists for males and females and loop over clients and fill the lists with the information with [append](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp)
   Hint2: combine prints with loop in order to solve the exercise

**Solution**:

```python
males = [] #empty list
females = [] #empty list
for client in clients:  #for loop iterates over the members of a sequence. (client: each member of list clients)
    #if statement is used to  run different blocks of code depending on a condition. 
    if ( client['gender'] == "male" ): #condition: checks if value of key 'gender' is equal to 'male' 
         males.append((client['name'],client['balance'])) #if the condition is satisfied appends a tuple with name and balance of the client to list males
    else: #we use else for any case that doesn't meet the condition on the if or elif statements
         females.append((client['name'],client['balance'])) #when the value of 'gender' is not equal to 'male' appends a tuple with name and balance of the client to list males

print("Males:")

for male in males: #iterating for each memeber of the list males (each member is a tuple with two strings: name and balance of a client)
     print("{}, balance: {}".format(male[0],male[1])) #prints name and balance of each cliente in males list

print("Females:")
for female in females:#iterating for each memeber of the list females (each member is a tuple with two strings: name and balance of a client)
     print("{}, balance: {}".format(female[0],female[1])) #prints name and balance of each cliente in males list

#REMEMBER: Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. 
```

- Compute and print the average balance for males and females

**Solution**:

```python
male_balances = 0  #initializing variable
female_balances = 0 #initializing variable

for male in males: #for loop itering previous list males
     male_balances += float(male[1][1:].replace(",","")) #in each iteration adds to variable male_balances the balance of each male client

male_balances /= len(males) #divides variable male_balances by the length of males and stores the result in male_balances
print("The mean balance for males is: {}".format(male_balances))
2566.42

for female in females:#for loop itering previous list females
     female_balances += float(female[1][1:].replace(",","")) #in each iteration adds to variable female_balances the balance of each male client

female_balances /= len(females) #divides variable female_balances by the length of females and stores the result in female_balances
print("The mean balance for females is: {}".format(female_balances))
2863.02
```

- What is the average age of all the clients?

**Solution**:

```python
ages = [] #empty list
average_age = 0  #initializing variable
for client in clients: #for loop itering list clients
     average_age += client['age'] #in each iteration adds to variable average_age the age of each client and stores the result in the variable

average_age /= len(clients) #divedes variable average_age by the length of the list clients and stores the result in the variable
average_age
28.33
```

- How many clients are active?

**Solution**:

```python
active = 0 #initializing variable
for client in clients: #for loop itering list clients
     if ( client['isActive'] == True ): #if statement. Checks if the value of the cliente status 'isActive' is True
             active += 1 #if the condition is satisfied, it adds 1 to the variable active and stores the result in the variable
                
print("The number of active clients is: {}".format(active))
3
```

- How many **unique** eye colors have the clients?

**Solution**:

```python
eyes = [] #initializing variable
for client in clients: #for loop itering list clients
     eyes.append(client['eyeColor']) #in each iteration we append the value of 'eyeColor' of each client en eyes list

print("The number of unique eye color is: {}".format(len(set(eyes)))) 
3
#set(eyes) transforms the list in a set of unique values, with len we get number of elements of the list
```

Consider making use of variables, loops and if-else.
