### Activity 3.2.3 - Solution


* Load the file `test2.csv`  ( included in the "activities" folder ) into a Pandas dataframe

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv("data/test2.csv", sep = ";")
   # pandas.read_csv Read a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame.
      # sep = Delimiter to use. 
    ```

* Make a single plot with the histogram of each variable

    **Solution**:

    ```python
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,data.shape[1], figsize=(5*data.shape[1],5)) # initializes subplots
    # dataFrame.shape: returns a tuple with the number of rows and columns of the dataframe
      # data.shape[1] returns the number of columns of our dataframe
      # in this case the configuration of the subplot whill depend on the shape of our dataframe
    for i in range(data.shape[1]): # data has 3 columns, so this for iterates 3 times
        ax[i].hist(data.iloc[:,i], bins = 20);
         #i = index position in subplot
         # hist = histogram
         # DataFrame.iloc: integer-location based indexing for selection by position.[rows, columns] 
            # in this case: : = all rows, i = index of the column
         # bins: the number of bars         
        ax[i].set_xlabel(list(data.columns)[i]) #sets the name of x-axis

    fig.show() #displays the figure
    ```

* Which variables seems to follow a normal distribution?

    **Solution**:

    `x4`. `x2` and `x3` are too spiked.

* Can you use a multivariate linear model using all the `x` variables to predict the variable `y` directly? Why?

    **Solution**:

    No, because in order to do so, all the independent features and the dependent features should follow a normal distribution.
    Otherwise the performance of the model will be heavily compromised. 
    Be aware that this is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have a good performant multivariate linear model.

* Did you spot any pair of variables which can be used directly to construct a linear model?

    **Solution**:

    - No. `x4` could be used as an independent feature. However, `y` doesn't seem to follow a normal distribution. 
    - Therefore, it's not possible to construct a multiple linear model using the variables as they are.
