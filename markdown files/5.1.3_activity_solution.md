### Activity 5.1.3

Make a copy of the last activity notebook and name it `Activity_5.1.3.ipynb`. Then answer the following questions:

1. Imagine that you did your data workflow in a single Jupyter notebook and you forgot to save your new model that took you several hours to train. Now for some reason your computer freezes and you need to restart the kernel and run it again. How much time it will take to you to finish running the notebook?

   - It will take again several hours to run the notebook to do something that you already did in the past.

2. What would happen if you had saved the model before? 

   - Then you only have to load the data, preprocess it and run again the model.
