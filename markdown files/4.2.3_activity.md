### Activity 4.2.3

Open a new Jupyter notebook and name it `Activity_4.2.3.ipynb` and then open a new "code cell" and add the following: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

1. Load again the data from file `data/customer_churn.csv`.
2. Get how many observations you have for every possible value of column `Churn`.
3. Import the function [SMOTE](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html?highlight=smote#imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE) and use it to balance the dataset (use the same independent features used during the lesson).
4. How many samples you have of each class after balancing?
5. Now import the function [TomekLinks](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.under_sampling.TomekLinks.html?highlight=tomeklinks#imblearn.under_sampling.TomekLinks) and use it to balance the dataset (use the same independent features used during the lesson).
6. How many samples you have of each class after balancing? Discuss it.
