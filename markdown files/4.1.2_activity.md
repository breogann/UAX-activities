### Activity 4.1.2

Make a copy of the code along jupyter notebook and name it as `Activity_4.1.2.ipynb`. 
 
 - Restart the Kernel and clear the output
 - Run all the cells until the section `Data Splitting`
 - Run again the `train_test_split` function but this time set the option `random_state` to any other integer value with two digits
 - Replace the names of the scaler in the `save_scaler()` function
 - Replace the name of the model in the `save_model()` function
 - Run the remaining cells to generate a new model
 - Compare the new coefficients of the model with the old ones obtained in the code along
 - Are the most important variables the same? 
 - Are the associated coefficients the same as the obtained during the lesson?
