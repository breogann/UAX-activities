### Activity 3.2.3

Open a new jupyter notebook. Name it as `Activity_3.2.3.ipynb` and do the following:

- Load the file `test2.csv`  ( included in the "activities" folder ) into a Pandas dataframe
- Make a single plot with the histogram of each variable
- Which variables seems to follow a normal distribution?
- Can you use a multivariate linear model  using all the `x` variables to predict the variable `y` directly? Why?
- Did you spot any pair of variables which can be used directly to construct a linear model?
